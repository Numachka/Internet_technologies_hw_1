        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Volcán de Fuego (Spanish pronunciation: [bolˈkan de ˈfweɣo]; Spanish for "Volcano of Fire", often shortened
            to Fuego) or Chi Q'aq' (Kaqchikel for "where the fire is") is an active stratovolcano in Guatemala, on the
            borders of Chimaltenango, Escuintla and Sacatepéquez departments. <br>
            It sits about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of Antigua, one of Guatemala's most famous cities and a tourist
            destination.<br>
            It has erupted frequently since the Spanish conquest, most recently in June and November 2018. <br>
            Fuego is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Small gas and ash eruptions occur every
            15 to 20 minutes, but larger eruptions are rare.
            Andesite and basalt lava types dominate, and recent eruptions have tended to be more mafic than older ones.
